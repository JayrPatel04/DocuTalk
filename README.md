## 🧑‍💻 My Contribution

I primarily contributed to the frontend of **DocuTalk**. I built the user interface using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, implemented the **PDF upload workflow**, and integrated the **Q&A interface** with the backend. I also focused on making the UI intuitive and responsive across devices.

In addition, I was responsible for implementing **secure user authentication using Clerk**. I ensured that routes for uploading and viewing documents were properly protected, enhancing both user experience and data security.

Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with teammates, participated in code reviews, and helped debug integration issues to ensure smooth end-to-end functionality.
